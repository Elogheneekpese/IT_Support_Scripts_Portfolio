# VPN Connection Fixes Guide

**What Is This?**  
This is a comprehensive Markdown guide designed to help users and IT support staff diagnose and resolve common issues encountered when trying to establish or maintain a Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection. VPNs are crucial for secure remote access, and problems can range from simple configuration errors to more complex network or software conflicts. This guide provides step-by-step troubleshooting for frequent scenarios, ensuring users can regain secure connectivity quickly.

## 1. VPN Not Connecting or "Stuck" Connecting

This is the most common issue, where the VPN client fails to establish a connection or gets stuck in a "connecting" state.

- **Check Internet Connection:** Ensure your internet is working (e.g., try browsing normally).
- **Verify Credentials:** Double-check your VPN username and password.
- **Restart VPN Client:** Close the VPN app completely and reopen it.
- **Try Different Server/Location:** Use an alternate server (if your VPN offers it).
- **Restart Computer:** This clears many temporary network issues.
- **Check VPN Service Status:** Visit your VPN provider’s status page or contact IT.
- **Firewall Interference:**
  - Temporarily disable the firewall to test (Windows Firewall or third-party).
  - If successful, add the VPN to firewall exceptions and re-enable it.
- **Antivirus Software:**
  - Some antivirus programs block VPNs. Temporarily disable it to test.
- **Network Change:** If you've changed networks recently (e.g., Wi-Fi to mobile), restart your computer and VPN app.

## 2. Connected to VPN, but "No Internet Access" (Split Tunneling vs. Full Tunneling)

You’re connected, but can’t access the internet or internal resources.

- **Full Tunneling:** All traffic goes through the VPN. If nothing works, the VPN tunnel might be broken.
- **Split Tunneling:** Only corporate traffic goes through the VPN. If internet works but internal resources don’t — it’s a routing/DNS issue.

### Try These Fixes:
- **Flush DNS Cache:**
  - Open Command Prompt as Admin and run: `ipconfig /flushdns`
- **Change VPN Protocol:** Try switching from OpenVPN to TCP, or to IKEv2 if available.
- **Check VPN Adapter DNS Settings:**
  - Go to Network Connections > Right-click VPN Adapter > Properties > IPv4 Settings
  - Ensure DNS is set to “automatic” or correct internal DNS servers are entered.
- **Disable IPv6 (temporarily):**
  - Uncheck “Internet Protocol Version 6” in adapter settings.
- **Check Router VPN Support:**
  - Some routers require "VPN passthrough" to be enabled.

## 3. Slow VPN Connection Speed

If your VPN is extremely slow after connecting:

- **Check Base Internet Speed:** Disconnect VPN and run a speed test (e.g., speedtest.net).
- **Try Another VPN Server:** Pick a server closer to your physical location.
- **Switch Protocols:** WireGuard and IKEv2 are faster than OpenVPN in many cases.
- **Router Congestion:** Too many devices on your Wi-Fi? Try Ethernet or reduce traffic.
- **Stop Background Downloads:** Pause system updates, cloud sync, or other downloads.
- **Check VPN Client Settings:** Some VPNs let you tweak packet size or compression.
- **ISP Throttling:** In rare cases, ISPs throttle VPN traffic. Try a different protocol or port.

## 4. VPN Client Software Issues

When the VPN software itself is acting up:

- **Update the VPN App:** Always use the latest version.
- **Reinstall the VPN Client:**
  - Uninstall from Control Panel
  - Restart your computer
  - Download and install the latest version
- **Check Logs for Errors:**
  - Most VPN apps have a logs/diagnostics section with error codes
  - Save logs and provide to IT if further help is needed

## 5. Authentication or Credential Errors

Seeing messages like “Authentication failed” or “Invalid credentials”?

- **Double-check Username/Password:** Look for typos or case-sensitivity.
- **Check Account Status:** Your account might be locked, expired, or disabled.
- **MFA/2FA Issues:** Make sure you’re entering the correct code from your authenticator or device.
- **Sync Computer Time:** Authentication may fail if your PC’s clock is out of sync.

## 6. General Troubleshooting Steps

If all else fails:

- **Run Windows Network Troubleshooter:**
  - Go to Settings > Troubleshoot > Additional Troubleshooters
- **Reset Network Settings:**
  - Open Command Prompt as Admin and run:
    ```
    netsh winsock reset
    netsh int ip reset
    ipconfig /release
    ipconfig /renew
    ```
  - Then restart your PC
- **Contact IT Support:**
  - Provide error codes, VPN logs, and a summary of steps you've already tried.
